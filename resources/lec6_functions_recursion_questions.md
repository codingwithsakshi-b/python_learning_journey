# 🧠 Lecture 6: Functions & Recursion — Practice Questions

## 🔹 1. User-Defined Function Practice

1. **Write a function to calculate the sum of two numbers.**
2. **Write a function that prints “hello”.**
3. **Write a function to calculate the average of three numbers.**
4. **Write a function to calculate the product of two numbers using default parameters.**
5. **Write a function to convert USD to INR.**  
   *(Assume 1 USD = 86 INR)*
6. **Write a function to check if a number is even or odd.**
7. **Write a function that returns the maximum of three numbers.** *(Optional Extension)*
8. **Write a function to print the length of a list.**
9. **Write a function to print all elements of a list in a single line.**

## 🔹 2. Recursion Practice

1. **Write a recursive function that prints numbers from `n` to 1.**  
   (e.g. `show(n)` → prints `n`, `n-1`, ..., `1`)
2. **Write a recursive function to calculate factorial of a number `n`.**
3. **Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of first `n` natural numbers.**
4. **Write a recursive function to print all elements in a list (one by one).**  
   (Using an index parameter — like `char_list(l, idx)`)

## 💡 Tip:
- Try solving the questions without checking the solutions.
- Attempt both iterative and recursive versions where possible.
- Return values can make functions more reusable in larger programs.

Happy Coding! 💻✨
