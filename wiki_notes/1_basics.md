# 🧠 Python Basics

---

## ✅ Overview

- Python is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language.
- It is dynamically typed and supports multiple programming paradigms.
- File extension: `.py`
- Python uses **indentation** (whitespace) to define code blocks.

## 🔤 Keywords

-Some important keywords in Python:
and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is,
lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield

## 💡 Variables
-No need to declare the data type separately.
-Variables are created when a value is assigned.
-Python is case-sensitive.

## 🔄 Type Conversion & Casting
| Function     | Description                      | Example             |
|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| `int(x)`     | Converts `x` to integer          | `int("5") → 5`      |
| `float(x)`   | Converts `x` to float            | `float("5.6") → 5.6`|
| `str(x)`     | Converts `x` to string           | `str(5) → "5"`      |
| `bool(x)`    | Converts `x` to boolean          | `bool(0) → False`   |

-eg.a = "100"
b = int(a)   # b = 100 (int)

## ➕ Operators
## Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Name            | Example       | Result |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| `+`      | Addition         | `3 + 2`       | `5`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `5 - 1`       | `4`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `4 * 2`       | `8`    |
| `/`      | Division         | `10 / 2`      | `5.0`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division   | `10 // 3`     | `3`    |
| `%`      | Modulus          | `10 % 3`      | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation   | `2 ** 3`      | `8`    |


- Relational (Comparison) Operators
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

- Logical Operators
and, or, not

- Assignment Operators
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=

## 🔍 Type Checking
-x = 5
-print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

## 📌 Fun Fact
>Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, and it's named after Monty Python, not the snake!
