# 🧠 Python Basics

---

## ✅ Overview

- Python is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language.
- It is dynamically typed and supports multiple programming paradigms.
- File extension: `.py`
- Python uses **indentation** (whitespace) to define code blocks.

##💡 Variables
-No need to declare the data type separately.
-Variables are created when a value is assigned.
-Python is case-sensitive.

##🔄 Type Conversion & Casting
|Type   |  |	Syntax|
|Integer|  |	int(x)|
|Float	|  |float(x)|
|String |  |str(x)  |
|Boolean|	 |bool(x) |
-eg.a = "100"
b = int(a)   # b = 100 (int)

##➕ Operators
#Arithmetic Operators
Operator	Meaning	Example
+	Addition	3 + 2 = 5
-	Subtraction	5 - 1 = 4
*	Multiplication	4 * 2 = 8
/	Division	10 / 2 = 5.0
//	Floor Division	10 // 3 = 3
%	Modulus	10 % 3 = 1
**	Exponentiation	2 ** 3 = 8

#Relational (Comparison) Operators
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

#Logical Operators
and, or, not

#Assignment Operators
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=

##🔍 Type Checking
x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

##📌 Fun Fact
>Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, and it's named after Monty Python, not the snake!
